"I am  the best candidate for this Opportunity " : what made me believe strongly in this quote is

    the reason why I have a conviction for discipline , hard work and organization which, for me are the keys of success  , and through
    my humble experience all a long my cursus I concluded that sharing knowledge is the best way by far  to contribute to the
    community , and indeed ,  I've already started to bring that to light , by mentoring kids and organizing education sessions during summer camp
    in kids in my neighborhood and I want to take that  even further and share it with other mentalities that have always amazed me

        In university ,  I am an active member in two clubs, a scientific and cultural, this latter is an intermediary

       make new relationships and communicate. This fact excites me more about the opportunity

    me continuously to apply and discover this people's culture and the wonderful places their.
